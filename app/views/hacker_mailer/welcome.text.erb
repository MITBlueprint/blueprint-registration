Hi!

You are receiving this email because you have made an account for Blueprint. (http://blueprint.hackmit.org)

Please be sure to fill out the registration form and indicate if you would like to come to the learnathon and/or the hackathon. If you would like to indicate a team, be sure that you and your teammates have the same team code. Once registration closes, we will be running a lottery to pick students for Blueprint until capacity is filled.

Thanks for registering!

Best,
The Blueprint Team
